Data Imputation folder used data from UK data service. Two surveys - the NDNS and the HSE were imputed using hot-deck imputation. This section is predominantly in R as this was recommended by my supervisor.

ABM folder is in Python and uses population generated from the Data Imputation part to find strength of relationships between characteristics in people.
